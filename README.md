# Bike_Sharing_Regression
In this project the goal was to implement differents regression algorithms on a data set related to a bike sharing system.
The following methods have been implemented: 

1 - Linear regreesion

2- k nearest neighbour(KNN) regression

3- Decision tree regreesion 

4- Support vector machine regression

In order to, feed the models Cross validation and Grid Search methods have been used. And the results have been compared toghether by means of statical analysis.
Following that, there is a section in which we tried to implement the cross validation method manually and this was compared to the built in cross validation in the library.
